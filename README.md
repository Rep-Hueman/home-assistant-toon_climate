# Toon Climate Component
This is a Custom Component for Home-Assistant (https://home-assistant.io) that provides a climate device for rooted Toon thermostats.

You can read and control thermostat mode and presets, read current temperature and control the setpoint.

Based on the standard behavior of the Toon the following two work modes are supported:
- Heat:     Heat to a target temperature (schedule off)
- Auto:     Follow the configured schedule as configured in your Toon (schedule on)

The following five presets are supported
- Away:     This will change the setpoint to what you have configured in your Toon for the away state
- Home:     This will change the setpoint to what you have configured in your Toon for the home state
- Comfort:  This will change the setpoint to what you have configured in your Toon for the comfort state
- Sleep:    This will change the setpoint to what you have configured in your Toon for the sleep state

(*) The above four presets can be used independent of the selected work mode.
    -   When the Toon is set to "heat" mode the preset will change the setpoint to the setpoint
        configured for the respective preset. It will keep that setpoint until you change it manually 
        or switch to "auto" mode
    -   When the Toon is set to "auto" mode the preset will change the setpoint to the setpoint configured
        for the respective preset. However it will only change the setpoint temporatily until the schedule 
        changes to the next programmed preset. 

- Eco:      This will be used for the vacation mode the Toon offers. Regardless of the active work mode
            the preset will change the setpoint to the setpoint configured for the "vacation" setting. It
            will stay in this mode untill you change to one of the other four presets or chnage the work 
            mode. So as long as the Toon is in eco (vacation) mode it will ensure the temperature does not
            drop below the set setpoint.
            
(*) Please note that to use the "eco" (vacation) setpoint you will need to activate the vacation mode at 
    least once on your Toon. If not the setpoint will use the lowest temperature (6 degrees celcius)

NOTE: This component only works with rooted Toon devices.
Toon thermostats are available in The Netherlands and Belgium.

More information about rooting your Toon can be found here:

Toon with simple-thermostat in Lovelace

![alt text](https://github.com/cyberjunky/home-assistant-toon_climate/blob/master/screenshots/toon-simple.png?raw=true "Toon simple-thermostat Screenshot")

Install Javascript from: https://github.com/nervetattoo/simple-thermostat


Using this card (replace 'climate.toon' with your device name if different):
```
   - type: 'custom:simple-thermostat'
     entity: climate.toon
     control:
       - preset
```

For the following examples please replace 'climate.toon' with your own climate device name if different.

If you want to automate changing the working mode of your Toon you can use the folowing scripts:

```yaml
script:
  - toon_enable_manual_mode:
      alias: Toon enable Manual mode
      sequence:
      - service: climate.set_hvac_mode
        data:
          hvac_mode: 'heat'
        entity_id: climate.toon
      mode: single
  - toon_enable_schedule_mode:
      alias: Toon enable Schedule mode
      sequence:
      - service: climate.set_hvac_mode
        data:
          hvac_mode: 'auto'
        entity_id: climate.toon
      mode: single
```


If you want to automate changing the standard presets of your Toon you can use the folowing scripts:

```yaml
script:
  - toon_activate_preset_comfort:
      alias: Toon activate preset Comfort
      sequence:
      - service: climate.set_preset_mode
        data:
          preset_mode: 'comfort'
        entity_id: climate.toon
      mode: single
  - toon_activate_preset_away:
      alias: Toon activate preset Away
      sequence:
      - service: climate.set_preset_mode
        data:
          preset_mode: 'away'
        entity_id: climate.toon
      mode: single
  - toon_activate_preset_home:
      alias: Toon activate preset Home
      sequence:
      - service: climate.set_preset_mode
        data:
          preset_mode: 'home'
        entity_id: climate.toon
      mode: single
  - toon_activate_preset_sleep:
      alias: Toon activate preset Sleep
      sequence:
      - service: climate.set_preset_mode
        data:
          preset_mode: 'sleep'
        entity_id: climate.toon
      mode: single
```


And in case you want to use the additional "vacation" feature you can use the following script:

```yaml
script:    
  - toon_activate_preset_eco:
      alias: Toon activate preset Eco
      sequence:
      - service: climate.set_preset_mode
        data:
          preset_mode: eco
        entity_id: climate.toon
      mode: single
```

As a result the Toon Climate Component will put the Toon in "vacation" mode. In this mode none of the standard presets in 
the Toon are activated. Instead it will use the setpoint that was set the last time the vacation mode on the Toon device 
itself was actiated. It will ensure the room will not drop below that specific setpoint. This vacation mode will be cancelled 
as soon as any of the presets on the Toon device are selected or by means of the Toon Climate Component being triggered 
through either the climate card in Home Assistant or any related home assistant scripts or automation requests.


If you want a sensor that provides you with the current working mode of the Toon (manual, auto or vacation) add the following:
```yaml
sensor:
- platform: template
  sensors:
    toon_operation_mode:
      friendly_name: 'Programma'
        value_template: >-
        {% if is_state('climate.toon','off') %}
          Vakantie
        {% elif is_state('climate.toon','heat') %}
          Handmatig
        {% elif is_state('climate.toon','auto') %}
          Automatisch
        {% endif %}
```


If you want a sensor that allows you to show the current room temperature (e.g. in a badge) add the following:

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
    - name: "Temperatuur Woonkamer"
      state: "{{ state_attr('climate.toon','current_temperature') }}"
      unit_of_measurement: °C
      device_class: temperature
      state_class: measurement        
```


If you have a Toon2 and want to gather the environment sensor data you can create REST sensors like this:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: Toon2 AirSensors
    json_attributes:
      - humidity
      - tvoc
      - eco2
    value_template: '{{ value_json["temperature"] }}'
    device_class: temperature
    unit_of_measurement: "°C"
    resource: http://192.168.2.106/tsc/sensors

template:
  - sensor:
    - name: "Toon2 Humidity"
      state: '{{ states.sensor.toon2_airsensors.attributes["humidity"] }}'
      device_class: humidity
      state_class: measurement
    - name: "Toon2 TVOC"
      state: '{{ states.sensor.toon2_airsensors.attributes["tvoc"] }}'
      device_class: volatile_organic_compounds
      state_class: measurement
    - name: "Toon2 eCO2"
      state: '{{ states.sensor.toon2_airsensors.attributes["eco2"] }}'
      device_class: carbon_dioxide
      state_class: measurement
```


You can create a sensor with more heating information like so:

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
    - name: "Toon Driewegklep"
      state: >-
          {% if is_state_attr('climate.toon','burner_info', 0) %}
             Neutraal
          {% elif is_state_attr('climate.toon','burner_info', 1) %}
             CV
          {% elif is_state_attr('climate.toon','burner_info', 2) %}
             Warm Water
          {% endif %}
```

Trigger on burner state change (example from CV to Neutral):
```yaml

automation:
  - alias: "Detect Burnerstate change"
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: climate.toon_thermostat
    condition:
      condition: template
      value_template: >
        {{ trigger.from_state and
            trigger.to_state.attributes.burner_info == 0 and
            trigger.from_state.attributes.burner_info == 1}}
    action:
      service: persistent_notification.create
      data:
        message: Burner state changed!
        title: "Thermostat Info"
```
          
You can also control the Toon device with Google's assistant.
